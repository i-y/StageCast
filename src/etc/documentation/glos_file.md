| **Calendar date**         | Any numeric date in the modern Gregorian calendar. For example, the 5th of October, 2010 could be represented as 10/05/2010.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Cross-Platform**        | Refers to the ability of a program to run on multiple operating systems. A fully cross-platform program would run on Windows, Linux, or Mac without the user having to do anything to it. In some cases, it can also refer to programs written in such a way that they can be easily recompiled to run on one operating system or another but the binary itself is tied to whatever operating system it was compiled for.                     |
| **GUI**                   | Graphical User Interface. Refers to the modern use of computer graphics to provide an interactive way to get input from the user and display output. This is in contrast to a text or command-line based system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Instar**                | A developmental stage in the life cycle of insects. Used in this document in a more general way to specify the discrete stages of life in any organism with such discrete stages that the model can be applied to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Java**                  | A cross-platform programming language developed and maintained by Oracle. It is an industry-standard Object Oriented Language suitable for applications of almost any size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **JavaFX**                | A development platform for graphical applications. Part of the Java language ecosystem, it has recently replaced an older set of tools called Java Swing. At the time of this writing, it has not been fully integrated into the platform across every device but the company that maintains Java, Oracle, is nearing that point.                                                                                                             |
| **Julian Date**           | A numeric date expressed as the number of days since January 1st of that year, with January 1st being recorded as day 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **MVC**                   | Model-View-Controller. This is a form of software architecture that separates the program into three distinct portions. The model holds the information being acted on, the view is what the user is able to see, and the controller is the portion of the program that manipulates the data stored in the model portion of the program.                                                                                                      |
| **Phenology**             | The study of the life cycle of plants or insects and how they are affected by weather or climate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **R**                     | In this context, refers to a scripting language geared towards scientific applications. Frequently used for statistical work and graphing. The language is free and open source, cross-platform, and not managed by a single corporation. R descends from a language called S, which is still in use for similar purposes.                                                                                                                    |
| **Software Architecture** | The layout of the source code of the program itself. An architectural plan or style defines how the source code is organized physically and how each element of the program relates to other program elements. Having a structured plan usually greatly increases the readability and maintainability of the code as elements of the program are placed in to the source code in a systematic way, rather than ad hoc as the system develops. |
| **XML**                   | A method, similar to HTML, to mark up data. Marking up the data simply means that elements are put between tags that tell a program what the data actually is. This is used in some files to allow the Java program to more easily import settings information or databases. The files are still in plain text though and can be easily opened and read by a user with a standard text editor.                                                |
